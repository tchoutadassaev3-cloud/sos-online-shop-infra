# SOS Online Shop — DevOps Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the DevOps implementation for **SOS Online Shop**, an e-commerce platform.  
The project focuses on automating cloud infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, testing, monitoring, and security using industry-standard DevOps practices.

This work is developed as part of an academic **Capstone Project**, demonstrating real-world DevOps workflows and cloud deployment strategies.



## Project Objectives
- Automate infrastructure deployment using **Terraform**
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**
- Ensure infrastructure validation and testing
- Apply cloud security best practices
- Enable monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Align implementation with an IEEE 29148-compliant SDD



## Architecture Overview
The solution uses AWS managed services to reduce operational complexity:

- **GitHub** — Source control
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD automation
- **Terraform** — Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS Services**:
  - VPC (Public & Private Subnets)
  - Application Load Balancer
  - ECS / Elastic Beanstalk (Compute)
  - RDS & DynamoDB (Data Layer)
  - S3 & CloudFront (Storage & CDN)
  - CloudWatch & SNS (Monitoring & Alerts)
  - IAM & KMS (Security)

CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automatically:

Validates Terraform configuration

Ensures infrastructure consistency

Prevents faulty changes from being merged

Pipeline stages include:

Source checkout

Terraform initialization

Terraform validation

Deployment readiness checks

🧪 Testing Strategy

Infrastructure validation using terraform validate

CI pipeline execution testing via GitHub Actions

Manual smoke testing for deployment readiness

Security checks through IAM role separation and encryption policies

🔐 Security Considerations

Least-privilege IAM roles

Encrypted storage using AWS KMS

Secure secrets handling via GitHub Actions

HTTPS enforced at load balancer and CDN level

📊 Monitoring & Logging

Application and infrastructure metrics via CloudWatch

Alerts delivered through SNS

Log aggregation for troubleshooting and audits
